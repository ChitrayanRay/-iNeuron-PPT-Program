    "Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that uses L2 regularization. It adds the sum of squared values of the regression coefficients to the loss function, scaled by a regularization parameter (lambda or alpha). The regularization term encourages the regression coefficients to be small, promoting models with smaller parameter values and reducing the impact of multicollinearity. Ridge regression helps to stabilize the model and improve its generalization by avoiding extreme parameter values and overfitting."

Training is stopped early when the performance on the validation set starts to deteriorate or no longer improves.
